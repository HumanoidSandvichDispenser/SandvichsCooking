Last Updated 8/11/2018

# About
Since it is difficult to publish onto the Garry's Mod Workshop, I have decided to release it here. Because this addon is currently in-development, GitHub would be a perfect place to put this.

This addon allows your player to cook food, make drinks, and other stuff. We are adding many more features, and improving the cooking system.

<font size="3">You are free to make any change to this addon (It would be great if you collaborate and commit or write issues). However, you may not publish it without linking back to this page.</font>

# Requirements
This addon **requires Team Fortress 2 installed** and the [Food and Household Items](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108024198&searchtext=food+and+household+items) addon by CHILI in order to view most models correctly.

# Installation
To install this addon, make sure all requirements are fulfilled and place the `sandvichcooking` folder to the addons folder, which is located at

`[YOUR STEAM FOLDER]\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\`
